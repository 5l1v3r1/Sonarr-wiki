Hey,

When I try to add a new TV show into Sonarr, it just's say can't find what you're looking for, this is on lots of tV shows I try, please let me know if you need any logs or info etc, thanks!
I'm running windows 7, recently upgraded to Win 10 and then back again, and a fresh install of Sonarr to try and solve the issue.

Thanks! :)
