### Method 1 (Recommended): Upstart (Ubuntu based distros)
Using Upstart allows for more advanced features, such as start/stop and automatic restart if it would crash.

**Create the NzbDrone Upstart config file**
       
    sudoedit /etc/init/nzbdrone.conf

**Paste in the following code, changing the username (right click if using terminal)**
```bash
author "Simon Tallmyr - Nosscire"
description "Upstart Script to run NzbDrone as a service on Ubuntu/Debian based systems, as well as others"

#Set username for the process. Should probably be what you use for logging in
setuid yourusername

#This is the install directory. If you installed using a deb package or the NzbDrone Repository you do not need to change this
env DIR=/opt/NzbDrone

setgid nogroup
start on runlevel [2345]
stop on runlevel [016]

#respawn will break the built-in updating, if you wish to enable respawn you need to make sure updates are disabled within the UI
#respawn

exec mono --debug $DIR/NzbDrone.exe

```

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> then <kbd>y</kbd> to save.

**Start NzbDrone**

	sudo start nzbdrone


### Method 2: LSB style init-script (Debian/Ubuntu)

1) `sudoedit /etc/init.d/nzbdrone`

2) Paste the following:
```bash	

    #!/bin/bash
     
    ### BEGIN INIT INFO
    # Provides:          nzbdrone
    # Required-Start:    $local_fs $network $remote_fs

    ### END INIT INFO

    if ! [ -r ${DAEMON} ]; then echo "Can't read: ${DAEMON}" 2>&1; exit 1; fi
    if ! [ -x ${MONO} ]; then echo "Not executable: ${MONO}" 2>&1; exit 1; fi

    fi
     
    do_start() {
            RETVAL=1
            if [ -e ${PIDFILE} ]; then
                    if ! kill -0 $(cat ${PIDFILE}) &> /dev/null; then
                            rm -f $PIDFILE
                    fi
            fi
     
            log_daemon_msg "Starting ${DESC}" "${NAME}"
            if pgrep -f "^${MONO} ${DAEMON}" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
                    log_progress_msg "(already running?)"
            else
                    start-stop-daemon -q -d ${DATADIR} -c $RUNAS --start --background --make-pidfile --pidfile $PIDFILE --exec $MONO -- $DAEMON $DAEMON_OPTS
                    RETVAL=$?
            fi
            log_end_msg $RETVAL
    }
    do_stop() {
            RETVAL=1
            log_daemon_msg "Stopping ${DESC}" "${NAME}"
            if ! pgrep -f "^${MONO} ${DAEMON}" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
                    log_progress_msg "(not running?)"
            else
                    start-stop-daemon -q --stop --pidfile $PIDFILE --retry 15
                    RETVAL=$?
            fi
            log_end_msg $RETVAL
     
    }
     
    case "$1" in
      start)
            do_start
       ;;
      stop)
            do_stop
       ;;
     
      status)
            status_of_proc -p $PIDFILE $DAEMON $NAME && exit 0 || exit $?
       ;;
     
      restart|force-reload)
            do_stop;
            do_start;
       ;;
      *)
            N=/etc/init.d/$NAME
            echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|status|restart|force-reload}" >&2
            exit 1
       ;;
    esac
     
    exit 0
```
3) Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> then <kbd>y</kbd> to save.

4) `sudo insserv -v nzbdrone`

5) `sudo /etc/init.d/nzbdrone start`

Note: The script by default runs as root. I suggest adding an nzbdrone user (`useradd -m -d /var/lib/nzbdrone --gid nogroup nzbdrone`) and adjusting the script so that RUNASUSER=nzbdrone & RUNASGROUP=nogroup.

### Method 3: init.d script (Debian)###

Please see [here](https://github.com/NzbDrone/NzbDrone/wiki/Autostart-on-Debian).


### Method 4: RC.Local
**Please Note: This is not the most elegant solution but it works**
***
**This Method Provided by:** protocol77

This Guide is to help those who would like to use linux to run NZBDrone at time of writing this there is not "Install As Service" option like with the Windows Build so this needs to be done until a better alternative is found i have personally tested it so you should have no issues if you do please post in the NZBDrone Forums (http://forums.nzbdrone.com/) and someone will try and help you.

**First **
make sure NzbDrone is installed you can go here to find out how to do that https://github.com/NzbDrone/NzbDrone/wiki/Installation

Next I created a .sh or batch file to automate the process of type "sudo mono /opt/NzbDrone/NzbDrone.exe"
Here is a link to the batch file so it saves you all from having to do this even though it was easy if you open in a text editor you will see

**Batch File:** (Just Hit Download to grab it)
http://goo.gl/4c8yWg

Next there are two ways of doing this 

**Method One:**

is using rc.local you do this by opening a terminal windows and typing (without quotes) "sudo nano /etc/rc.local" (or if easier you can use a text editor like gedit, pluma, leafpad whatever you have just replace the nano part with what you want

Once this is open go to the bottom and just above where it says "exit 0" type the following for eg.

/bin/sh /home/server/Desktop/NzbDrone.sh

mine was saved to my desktop on my linux machine you will need to edit this to wherever you put the NzbDrone.sh file you downloaded above but remember to keep the /bin/sh first then a space then the rest

**Method Two:** (With Screenshots)

Go to your menu and find the application to set startup items this may be called many things mine was called Session And Startup

http://i.imgur.com/qqw8ghT.png

Once this is open i went to Application AutoStart there i clicked on the add button

http://i.imgur.com/FqVFXEQ.png

Next i added the following which you will notice is the same as the one in Method One "/bin/sh /home/server/Desktop/NzbDrone.sh"

http://i.imgur.com/8gokS5j.png

after that i gave it a name and then pressed "Ok" and then "Close" i then did a reboot of the system 

on reboot i did notice it took a couple more seconds to login this is because this is setting that command to run at login but once logged in i opened my browser and went to http://localhost:8989 and voila it started


I cannot guarantee this will work but it seems to be working for me i am Linux newbie and this took me a while to figure out so hopefully by posting here it will help someone else avoid the trouble i went through 

## Systemd

Modern Linux systems have been updated to use the new systemd standard.  The method is very simple and involves creating a service file then enabling it.

**Create the service file**

Be sure to modify the user, group, mono path and install directory.
```bash
cat > sonarr.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=Sonarr Daemon
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
User=<service username>
Group=<service group>

Type=simple
ExecStart=<path to mono> <path to NzbDrone.exe> -nobrowser
TimeoutStopSec=20

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

**Move the file to your systemd system directory**

Typically located in /usr/lib/systemd/system/, verify before proceeding.  Will differ based on distribution.

```bash
mv sonarr.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/
```

**Add Sonarr/NzbDrone to startup**

```bash
systemctl enable sonarr.service
```

**Start Sonarr/NzbDrone service**

Start sonarr via systemd and verify status.
    
```bash
systemctl start sonarr.service
systemctl status sonarr.service
```
