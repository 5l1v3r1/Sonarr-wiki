## Root Folders
Root folders are the parent folders that contain all of your TV Shows. Some examples are `D:\TV Shows` `D:\Media\TV`. You need to have at least one root folder before you can add any Series to your database.

## Add New Series
You need to use **Add New Series** section when you are about to add a brand new series. That means a show that you currently don't have in your root folder. This will create a new folder based on the name of the show and mark all episodes with exception of special episodes as monitored episodes.

To add a new series you can start typing the name of the series in the first text field. After a few seconds you should start getting auto complete results based on what you typed. When you find the series you want to add select a root folder from the drop down below (This will be the root folder the show will placed in) and select a quality profile for the new series. Click add and you are done.
