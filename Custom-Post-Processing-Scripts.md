If you're looking to trigger a custom script in your download client to tell Sonarr when to update, you can find more details here. Scripts are added to Sonarr via the *Connect* Settings page.

### Overview ###

Sonarr can execute a custom script when new episodes are imported or a series is renamed, depending on the which action occurred the parameters will be different. Parameters are passed to the script through environment variables (allowing for more flexibility in what we send to the script and not having to worry about a particular order). In all cases the Environment Variables Sonarr sends will be prefixed with `Sonarr` and converted to lowercase, the `Series_Id` will appear as `sonarr_series_id`.

### Specific usage tips ###
#### PHP ####
The information from Sonarr will not be added to $_ENV as one might expect but should be included in the [$_SERVER variable](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php). A sample script to use this information to convert a file can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/karbowiak/7fb38d346e368edc9d1a).
#### PowerShell ####
Sample script using the Sonarr environment variables to create EDL files for all episodes is [here](https://gist.github.com/RedsGT/e1b5f28e7b5b81e1e45378151e73ba5c).
