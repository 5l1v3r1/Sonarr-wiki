## What is Master Migration ##
We are starting a new process called Master Migration that pushes users back to master after major features are merged in. Most users don't have to do anything they will just be pushed back to master and get updates from our more tested and stable branch.

***If you plan to stay in develop you will need to switch back to develop after the migration period has ended (if you switch before you might get switched back to master again).*** 


## Why we are doing this ##
Over time many users have switched from master (our stable branch) to develop (our nightly branch) for many different reasons. But for most users it has been because they wanted to try a new feature (Anime, Torrent etc) or a fix to a problem they were having. However most of these don't want to actually stay on develop as long as they have the feature they wanted. That's why we are starting a new process called Master Migration that pushes users back to master after major features are merged into master.
