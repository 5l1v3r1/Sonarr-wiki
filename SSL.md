## Prerequisites ##
- SSL Cert with Private Key (Self-signed is okay)
- Cert loaded in Personal store of Local System

## Enabling SSL ##
You will need to edit NzbDrone's config file directly as these settings are not exposed in the UI

1. Open `C:\ProgramData\NzbDrone\config.xml`
2. Add/Change the following settings
	- SslPort - Default 9898
	- EnableSsl - default false
	- SslCertHash - this is the thumbnail/hash of the SSL certificate with all spaces removed (ie: 123456f6790a35f4b017b55d09e28f7ebe001bd)
3. Restart NzbDrone as administrator (so the SSL URL and Certificate can be registered with Windows).
4. Verify SSL connectivity
5. Restart NzbDrone as preferred (Service/Console/Tray).
