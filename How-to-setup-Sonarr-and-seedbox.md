HI all ;
         I am wondering if some could point me in the right direction. Have used sonar locally works great but would like to use it in conjunction with my seedbox, let it be the download client but would love to have files renamed ,moved back to local NAS to be served up with flex server later on.. 

         Is any of what I am saying possible to do?
