### Why do I need to create an Application ###
Each user is required to create an application in order to avoid reaching the PushOver API call limit. Drone has reached a point where its best for our users and for PushOver if each user has their own account. This avoids hitting the API limit like we did in December 2013.

### What does this new application give me ###
It gives you the ability to send up to 7500 messages per month, instead of the current 15000 limit we have imposed for all users.

### Where do I get the API Key?  ###
The API Key is found within application you created for your Drone, if you need to create one, you can do so here: https://pushover.net/apps/clone/nzbdrone
